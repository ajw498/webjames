PHP, which stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor", is an HTML-embedded
scripting language.  Much of its syntax is borrowed from C, Java and
Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown in.  The goal
of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically
generated pages quickly.
<p>
The scripts are interpreted by the server, so it works with all browsers.
<p>
As a simple example:
<pre>
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;PHP Example&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
This is standard &lt;B&gt;HTML&lt;/B&gt;

&lt;? echo("This is PHP"); ?&gt;

&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre>
The bits between &lt;? and ?&gt; are PHP code, the rest is normal HTML. In
this trivial example all the PHP does is to add the text This is PHP to
the HTML file. PHP is as powerful as a custom CGI script, but simpler to
use.
<p>
I have tried to make the minimum of changes whilst porting PHP, so it
should behave very similar to any other platform.  Thus a script written
in RISC OS should behave the same when uploaded to a Unix web server, or
vice versa.
<p>
There are three ways PHP can be used:
<ul>
<li>Standalone - Double click on a script, and it will be interpreted, and the ouput loaded into a browser. This is a bit limited and is not recommended for anything but the simplest scripts.
<li>As a CGI script for a webserver
<li>As a module for a webserver - The fastest method, but currently only available with WebJames.
</ul>

This file only deals with RISC OS specific issues, for general
information about PHP you should look at the PHP manual, or
<a href="http://www.php.net/">http://www.php.net/</a>
<p>
There is a simple introduction and links to other tutorials at
<a href="http://www.php.net/tut.php">http://www.php.net/tut.php</a>
<p>
The PHP manual is available is several formats from
<a href="http://www.php.net/download-docs.php">http://www.php.net/download-docs.php</a>,
and also in StrongHelp format from
<a href="http://www.php.alexwaugh.com/">http://www.php.alexwaugh.com/</a>
(Please note that the formatting of the StrongHelp manual is not particularly
good in places, as it was automatically converted from the HTML, but it is
useful to be able to search for a particular function easily.)

Ensure that the !PHP application has been seen before you try to run any
PHP scripts. You will also need a web browser to view the output. Double
click on !PHP, then select the Stand alone, single tasking icon, then
click on Save. Enter your script in a text editor such as !StrongEd,
!Zap or !Edit, and then save it. Set it's filetype to PHP. Double click
on it, and it will be interpreted, and the output loaded into your
browser.
<p>
If you want PHP to multi-task when interpreting your scripts, then
select the Stand alone, multitasking icon instead. For most scripts
there is little advantage to be gained from multitasking.
<p>
While quite a few scripts will work like this, ones that use GET and
POST variables from forms, generate images and so forth will only
work correctly when running under a web server.

I have succesfully tested PHP with the following servers
<ul>
<li>Navaho server suite (2.00b24) <a href="http://www.navaho.co.uk/support/">http://www.navaho.co.uk/support/</a>
<li>Netplex (0.22 and 1.70) <a href="http://www.warmsilence.demon.co.uk/products.html#Netplex">http://www.warmsilence.demon.co.uk/products.html#Netplex</a>
<li>ANT server suite 1.32 <a href="http://www.argonet.co.uk/ant/">http://www.argonet.co.uk/ant/</a>
<li>WebJames (0.24 and later) <a href="http://www.webjames.alexwaugh.com/">http://www.webjames.alexwaugh.com/</a>
</ul>
PHP does not work with DeltaNet or WebServe
<p>
Double click on !PHP, then select one of the CGI icons, according to
which server you are running, then click Save.

<p>
To use with Navaho, simply create your script in a text editor, make sure that
it's filetype is PHP, then put the script into Navaho's cgi-bin
directory.
<p>
To use with WebJames (I recommend you use version 0.30 or later), save your script anywhere in your Site directory, and make sure its filetype is PHP.
<p>
To use with the unregistered version of Netplex, or the ANT server, it
is slightly more complicated, as they will only run certain filetypes as
CGI programs, therefore put your PHP script in the cgi-bin directory,
with a name of (for example) Splodge. Then create an Obey file in the same
directory, called (for example) Squiggle. The obey file should contain the
line
<code>Run &lt;Obey$Dir&gt;.Splodge</code>
Then in your browser, entering
http://www.your.domain.com/cgi-bin/squiggle will run the PHP script.
<p>
For registered versions of Netplex (1.62 or later) you can either
use the above method, or you can open the !Netplex.Resources.UK.Messages
file and change the line PerlFiletype:&102 to PerlFiletype:&18A (This
will mean that you can't run Perl scripts though). Thanks to Nik Gare
for pointing this out.
<p>
The commercial version of Netplex (2.xx) shouldn't need either of the
above modifications, but I don't have a copy so haven't tested this.

</h3>
With this option, the PHP interpreter is compiled as part of the webserver,
and so is loaded whenever the webserver is loaded. This means that the
interpreter does not need to be loaded from disc every time a PHP script
is requested. As the PHP interpreter is quite large (over 1.4MB) then this
gives a significant speed increase.
<p>
This is only possible if you are using WebJames, and have downloaded the
version that has PHP support compiled in. You do <b>not</b> need the
<code>!PHP</code> application in this case.

<p>
<h3>
<table bgcolor="#cccccc" width="99%"><tr><td>
<a name="filenames">Filenames</a>
</td></tr></table>
</h3>
PHP uses UnixLib, and therefore takes advantage of it's filename
translation capabilities. Thus you may refer to files from your scripts
or the command line in RISC OS format or Unix format. I would suggest
using Unix format filenames in your scripts, so that they are more
portable. Note that if you use RISC OS filenames, they should be full
pathnames (such as ADFS::4.$.File or &lt;PHP$Dir&gt;.File) otherwise they may
be interpreted as Unix filenames. Under Unix, all PHP scripts should
have the filename extension php, but this is not necessary for RISC OS,
although doing so might help portability.

<p>
<h3>
<table bgcolor="#cccccc" width="99%"><tr><td>
<a name="memory">Memory</a>
</td></tr></table>
</h3>

PHP needs around 1.6Mb of free memory to run a simple script, and
complex scripts will need more. By default PHP is set up to use dynamic
areas. If you don't want it to you can disable their use by editing the
!PHP.!Boot file.

<p>
<h3>
<table bgcolor="#cccccc" width="99%"><tr><td>
<a name="config">Configuration</a>
</td></tr></table>
</h3>

You can double click on !PHP to configure which webserver you are
using (or standalone if you aren't using any webserver).
There are some other options that can be configured, although the
defaults should be fine for most people. To configure the other options,
copy the file php/ini into your !Boot.Choices directory, and then load
it into a text editor and make any alterations. Many of the options are
not relevant to the RISC OS port. More information on the options can be
found in the PHP manual. You may find changing the error_reporting
variable to 15 helps with debugging.

<p>
<h3>
<table bgcolor="#cccccc" width="99%"><tr><td>
<a name="mail">mail()</a>
</td></tr></table>
</h3>

If you have Justin Fletcher's <a href="http://www.movspclr.co.uk/software/internet.html#gmail">GMail</a>
program (and if it is correctly setup) then you can use the mail()
function in PHP to send emails.
<P>
If you are having problems, you can define the system variable <code>PHP$MailOut</code>
to a filename, and any messages from gmail will be directed to this file.
<br>Eg. <code>*Set PHP$MailOut ADFS::4.$.gmailoutput</code>
<p>
The mail function will not work when running under the ANT server suite or unregistered versions of Netplex. 

<p>
<h3>
<table bgcolor="#cccccc" width="99%"><tr><td>
<a name="extensions">Extension modules</a>

The following extensions have been included with PHP:
<ul>
<li>standard  Various common functions
<li>pcre      Perl compatible regular expressions
<li>calendar  Date related functions
<li>ftp       FTP client
<li>gd        Create/manipulate png/jpeg/wbpm images
<li>session   Tracking site visitors
<li>posix     POSIX functions
<li>mysql     MySQL client functions
<li>zlib      Compression functions
<li>xml       XML parsing
</ul>
If there are other extensions that you would like added then let me know
and I will take a look at them.

<p>

</td></tr></table>
</h3>
There are many functions in PHP, and I am not able to test every single
one of them, so if you come across something that doesn't work, please
let me know.
<p>
Some functions will not work as they do not have any meaning under RISC OS,
eg. Symbolic links and file ownership.
<p>
Due to the way the filename translation works, there are certain situations
where a file cannot be found even though it exists, eg index/php when there is
also a directory called index. In general, try to avoid using directory names
that match any of your filenames (either the part before the extension,
or the extension itself).
<p>
popen, system, exec, passthru and other functions that run external programs do work, but <b>only</b>
if the child program being run was compiled with a recent version of UnixLib (September 2001 or later).
The version of UnixLib supplied with GCC pre-release 3 is too old.
Additionally, they will not work when running under the ANT server suite or unregistered versions of Netplex.
<p>
fopen("http://localhost/"); does not work (but other urls do), as PHP is a
single tasking program, and so when it opens a connection to localhost,
it sits around doing nothing until it gets some data back. However,
the webserver will not be able to send any data back, as it never gets
a chance to run because PHP is still running.
However, any file you want to access via http://localhost can also be
accesed by fopen with the pathname of the file relative to the current
file, or an absolute pathname, which is faster anyway.
<p>
As RISC OS does not have an easilly accessible microsecond timer, the microsecond
part of the return value from microtime() will be zero, so srand(microtime()) does
not work as expected.
<p>
Any updates to the RISC OS port should be available from
<a href="http://www.php.alexwaugh.com/">http://www.php.alexwaugh.com/</a>
<p>
Please report any bugs to me in the first instance.

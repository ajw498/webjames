 <p>
 <h5>Installing this version from scratch</h5>

  To get things up and running, you will need to have an internet stack
 running. If you use the ANT suite, then you will need to ensure that
 local loopback is enabled.
 <p>
  If you have a driver for a network card already enabled then this should
 include loopback and so the loopback driver does not need to be explicitly
 selected.
  If it is not, then in the ANT configuration
 program, tick the LAN icon, then open the LAN setup window. Select
 <code>Loopback</code>
 from the driver list. Host name should be <code>localhost</code> and
 IP address <code>127.0.0.1</code> IP Mask <code>255.255.255.0</code> and
 leave Name server blank.
 <p>
 <p>
  The Acorn stack has loopback configured on by default.
 <p>
  You will also need the MimeMap module version 0.10 or later. If you
 don't have this then download it from <a href="http://www.movspclr.co.uk">
 http://www.movspclr.co.uk</a> and put it in !System.310.Modules.Network
 <p>
  Copy WebJames to a suitable location on your harddisc or wherever you
 may want to install it. Start WebJames by double-clicking on its icon.
 No icon will apear on the iconbar, but you can check that it is running
 by seeing if it is listed in the Task manager.
 <p>
  Check that your web browser is not set up to use a proxy server. If it is,
 then you will have to turn it off, or add localhost to the list of domains
 to exclude. You will not be able to run !WebServe on the same machine unless
 you set WebServe or WebJames to use different ports from each other. 
 <p>
  In your web browser, enter the URL <a href="http://localhost/">
 http://localhost/<a>, and you should get a page saying that WebJames
 is working.
 <p>
  You can now put your web pages in the <code>Site</code> directory
 or edit the <a href="#config">config file</a> to give the location of the pages.
 You should also change the webmaster email address and if possible server ip
 address in the <a href="#config">config file</a>.
 <p>
  The rest of the <a href="#config">config file</a>, and the <a href="#attr">
 attributes file</a> can be edited to suit your requirements, but the default
 values should be suitable to start with.  
 <p>
  The above assumes that you are running your browser on the same machine as
 WebJames is running on. If your broswer is running on another machine, either
 on a LAN or over the internet, then you should enter http://host/ in your
 browser where host is the hostname or IP address of the machine WebJames is
 running on.

 <p>
 <h5>Installing this version on top of an older version</h5>

  Go through all the steps in the table below and perform those that
 match the version you're installing the new version on top of.
  <em>This may overwrite log-files, configuration files, report templates
 and part of your website.</em>

<p>
<h3>
<table bgcolor="#cccccc" width="99%"><tr><td>
<a name="yoursite">About your site</a>
</td></tr></table>
</h3>

  The web site to be served by WebJames is usually stored in a single
 directory, and may hold any number of files and subdirectories. The path
 to the directory is set in the <a href="#config">config file</a>, which
 usually is <code>&lt;WebJames$Dir&gt;.config</code>.

 <p>
  The filepaths in incoming request will use unix-syntax instead of RISC OS
 syntax, so WebJames will switch / and . so the URI <code>/pics/file.gif</code>
 will refer to the file <code>pics.file/gif</code>.

 <p>
  If a request for a directory is received, WebJames will append
 the name of a default file (usually <code>index.html</code>) to the URI;
 thus a request for the URI <code>/whatever/</code> will usually return
 the file <code>whatever.index/html</code>. The name of the default file
 is an <a href="#attr">attribute</a> of the directory, and so may be changed
 by editing the <i>attributes</i> file.



<p>
<h3>
<table bgcolor="#cccccc" width="99%"><tr><td>
<a name="config">Configuration</a>
</td></tr></table>
</h3>

  The name of the config file is passed to WebJames as the first argument
 when WebJames is started. Usually the config file is
 <code>&lt;WebJames$Dir&gt;.config</code>.

 <p>
  The config file holds information about the location (on your harddisc)
 of your website, the location of various database files, the maximum
 network-bandwidth WebJames may use, port number (usually 80), log-files
 etc. See the configuration file for details of the various options.

 <p>
  There are rather a lot of options in the config file, but usually you
 will only need to edit the first field - the webmaster-email-address.

 <p>
 <h5>Case sensitivity</h5>
  The case sensitive option allows you check that all your links between files
 are in the correct case. It works on standard filecore filling systems such as
 ADFS that are not normally case sensitive, but it is not quite as efficient
 as the default case insensivity.


<p>
<h3>
<table bgcolor="#cccccc" width="99%"><tr><td>
<a name="attr">Attributes</a>
</td></tr></table>
</h3>

  The path to the 'attributes' database file is set in the 
 <a href="#config">config file</a>; it is usually
 <code>&lt;WebJames$Dir&gt;.attributes</code>.

 <p>
  The 'attributes' database defines attributes for any number of
 URIs/files/directories. Attributes are things like <i>cacheability</i>,
 <i>redirection</i>, <i>password-protection</i>, <i>cgi-script API</i> and
 more. <i>Realms</i> are also defined in the 'attributes' file.

 <p>
  It is considered an attribute of a file that it may be executed as a
 cgi-script; therefore, the name of the directory (or directories) that
 hold cgi-scripts is defined in the 'attributes' file rather than in the
 <a href="#config">config file</a>.

 <p>
  Attributes defined for a directory (eg. <code>/cgi-bin/</code>) apply to
 all files inside the directory; however, you may also define attributes
 for a single file or redefine attributes for files/URIs that have
 attributes defined elsewhere in the attributes file.

 <p>
  An attributes file consists of a number of sections, each section defines
 attributes for a file or directory.
 A section starts with eg. <code>&lt;location /uri/&gt;</code> and finished with
 <code>&lt;/location&gt;</code>.

 <p>
  If the URI ends in a <code>/</code>, it refers to a directory and all the
 files inside the directory; otherwise it refers to a file. The URI <b>must</b>
 start with a <code>/</code>.

 <p>
  The following fragment of an attributes file password-protects the
 <code>/private/</code> directory and all of its contents except the file
 <code>/private/busy.html</code>, and redirects the URI
 <code>/linux.html</code> to <code>http://www.linuxberg.com/</code> and
 also causes all request for URIs starting with <code>/~xyz/</code> to
 access a directory in the RAM disc and ensures that files in that
 directory will never be cached.<br>

 <pre>

 # password-protect (almost) everything in /private/
 &lt;location /private/&gt;
 userandpwd=myname:mypassword
 realm=privateparts
 &lt;/location&gt;
 # don't password-protect /private/busy.html, so just
 # set the password to &lt;empty&gt;
 &lt;location /private/busy.html&gt;
 userandpwd=
 &lt;/location&gt;

 # redirect /linux.html requests to www.linuxberg.com
 &lt;location /linux.html&gt;
 moved=http://www.linuxberg.com/
 &lt;/location&gt;

 # move /~xyz/ requests to the RAM disc, and don't
 # cache the contents of the RAM disc...
 &lt;location /~xyz/&gt;
 homedir=RAM:$.WebSite
 notcacheable
 &lt;/location&gt;

 # enable PUT-requests for the cgi-script that handles
 # PUT-requests
 #&lt;location /cgi-bin/PUT&gt;
 #methods="PUT"
 #&lt;/location&gt;

 # make private directory for 192.168.1.100
 &lt;location /private/johndoe/&gt;
 allowed-hosts=192.168.1.100
 &lt;/location&gt;
 </pre>

 <p>
  Please notice - you can only set a home-directory for
 <em>directories</em> - NOT for files (eg. for <code>/~xyz/</code> but
 not for <code>/~xyz/pic.gif</code>).

 <p>
  You can also create sections for specific directories using
 <code>&lt;directory ADFS::4.$.Dir&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/directory&gt;</code>
 The attributes within such a section will apply to anything fetched from
 that directory, whatever the URI was.
 <p>
  Attributes in a <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code> section take precedence over
 those in a <code>&lt;location&gt;</code> section.
 <p>
  It is preferable to use <a href="#htaccess">.htaccess</a> files rather than <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code>
  sections, as then if you move your website to a different directory on your hard disc, you
  don't have to alter all the <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code> sections.

 <p>
  There can also be <code>&lt;files&gt;</code> section, which apply the attributes
 to only files that have a leafname that matches. eg.
 <pre>
 # hide all files with a leafname of pic.gif
 &lt;files pic.gif&gt;
 hidden
 &lt;/files&gt;
 </pre>
 <p>
  <code>&lt;files&gt;</code> sections can be nested within a <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code> section, and then they
 will only apply to files within that directory.
 <p>
  Old style [/uri/] sections still work (they are treated as <code>&lt;location&gt;</code> sections), but their use is deprecated.

 <p>
 <h5>Regular expressions</h5>
 
 <p>
  In addition to the types of section described above, there are <code>&lt;locationmatch&gt;</code>,
 <code>&lt;directorymatch&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;filesmatch&gt;</code> sections. These take an
 extended regular expression, and apply it to the URI, directory or leafname respectively. If it
 matches then the attributes in the section are applied.
 <p>
  The regular expression matching is done by Henry Spencer's regex library.
 <p>
 Regular expressions are potentially complex, so I am not going to describe their syntax here.
 See the <a href="regex/re_formatmanpage">regex manpage</a> for more details.
 <pre>
 # this matches all leafnames that have between
 # 1 and 3 digits followed by .gif or .jpg
 &lt;filesmatch "^[0-9]{1,3}\.((gif)|(jpg))$"&gt;
 notcacheable
 &lt;/filesmatch&gt;
 </pre>
  The quotes around the regular expression are optional.
 
 <p>

 <h5>The order of section matching</h5>
 <p>
  The order in which a request is processed is as follows:
 <ul>
  <li>The URI is compared with all <code>&lt;location&gt;</code> sections.
  <li>The URI is compared with all <code>&lt;locationmatch&gt;</code> sections.
  <li>The URI is converted to a filename.
  <li>The filename is compared with all <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code> sections.
  <li>The filename is compared with all <code>&lt;directorymatch&gt;</code> sections.
  <li>If the request was for a directory, the relevant <code>defaultfile</code> list is
      searched until a file is found.
  <li>The leafname is compared with all <code>&lt;files&gt;</code> sections, with ones
      nested within other applicable sections taking priority over those not nested.
  <li>The leafname is compared with all <code>&lt;filesmatch&gt;</code> sections, with ones
      nested within other applicable sections taking priority over those not nested.
  <li>The leafname and filetype will be compared to any <code>AddHandler</code> or
      <code>AddFiletypeHandler</code>.
  <li>The relevant handler will be called to deal with the file.
 </ul>
 <p>
  Therefore if you define an attribute for a whole directory, and the opposite
 attribute for a specific file within that directory, then the directory attribute
 will be applied first, but the file attribute will then be applied later, thus
 overriding the directory attribute.
 <p>

 <td><code>errordocument</code></td>
 <td>this attribute allows error messages to be customised for individual directories.

 <h5>Nested attribute-files</h5>

  The <code>more-attributes</code> attribute allows you to have nested
 attribute-files; eg. if multiple sites are served by the server, the
 attributes for each site may have its attributes defined in a seperate
 file.

 <p>
  Example: assuming the users <code>joe</code> and <code>bob</code> both
 have their web-site on your server; the main attributes-file could then
 look like this:

 <pre>
 # main attributes file
 &lt;location /~joe/&gt;
 more-attributes=&lt;WebJames$Dir&gt;.sites.joe.~attributs
 &lt;/location&gt

 &lt;location /~bob/&gt;
 more-attributes=&lt;WebJames$Dir&gt;.sites.bob.~attributs
 &lt;/location&gt
 </pre>

 The attributes-file (<code>&lt;WebJames$Dir&gt;.sites.joe.~attributs</code>)
 could then look something like this:

 <pre>
 # attributes file for joe
 # all URIs in &lt;location&gt; are relative to /~joe/

 # set the base-directory for joe's site
 &lt;location /&gt;
 homedir=&lt;WebJames$Dir&gt;.sites.joe
 &lt;/location&gt

 # hide the attributes file for joe's site
 &lt;location /~attributs&gt;
 hidden
 &lt;/location&gt
 </pre>

  All requests for URIs starting with <code>/~joe/</code> would then access
 files in the <code>&lt;WebJames$Dir&gt;.sites.joe</code> directory; notice
 that the attribute-file for joe's site itself is stored inside joe's
 site-directory; this would be a security risk, if the file hadn't been
 marked inaccessible (by the <code>hidden</code> attribute).

 <p>
 Notice - you should not nest attribute-files in more than 3 levels.

 <a name="htaccess"><h5>htaccess files</h5></a>

  You can also specify attributes for a directory by putting them in an
 <code>htaccess</code> file within the directory. The name of the <code>htaccess</code>
 file is specified in the <a href="#config">config file</a>, and is by default
 <code>/htaccess</code>

 <p>
  The <code>htaccess</code> files are in the same format as the attributes file,
 but act as if the whole file was surrounded by a <code>&lt;directory dirname&gt;</code>
 section, where dirname is the directory the <code>htaccess</code> file is in.
 It can contain <code>&lt;files&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;filesmatch&gt;</code> sections,
 but not <code>&lt;location&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code> sections.
 <p>
  Please note that the <code>htaccess</code> files are cached, so if you alter one,
 then it may not take effect until you restart WebJames. Also, it you specify a
 <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code> section for a directory, then any <code>htaccess</code>
 file in that directory will be ignored.

<p>
<h3>
<table bgcolor="#cccccc" width="99%"><tr><td>
<a name="handlers">Handlers</a>
</td></tr></table>
</h3>

  When WebJames receives a request for a file, it decides what to do with the file
 (send it as it is, run it as a cgi script, etc.) according to any handlers set up
 in the attributes file.
 There are five handlers currently defined by WebJames (static-content, send-as-is, server-parsed,
 cgi-script and webjames-script), and more can be added with the <a href="#action">action</a>
 attribute.
 <p>
  You can use the <code>addhandler</code> attribute to assign a handler to files with
  a particular leafname extension, or <code>addfiletypehandler</code> to assign a handler
  to files with a particular filetype.
 <pre>
 # treat all leafnames ending in .cgi as cgi scripts
 AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

 # treat all files with a leafname of index as being normal files
 AddHandler static-content index

 # treat all files with a filetype of &amp;FFB (BASIC) as
 # webjames style cgi scripts
 AddFiletypeHandler webjames-script FFB

 # treat all files with a filetype of Perl as cgi scripts
 AddFiletypeHandler cgi-script Perl

 # treat any files that are not matched by another handler
 # as cgi scripts
 AddFiletypeHandler cgi-script

 # treat all files as webjames scripts. the ALL must be in capitals
 AddFiletypeHandler webjames-script ALL
 </pre>

  <code>Addhandler</code> or <code>addfiletypehandler</code> can be used outside of all the attributes sections, in
 which case they will apply to all files, or inside an <code>&lt;location&gt;</code>,
 <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;files&gt;</code> section, in which case they
 will only apply to files matched by that section.

 <h6>static-content</h6>

  This is the default handler, it simply sends the contents of the file
 requested.
 <p>

 <h6>send-as-is</h6>

  This is similar to static-content, but WebJames does not add any headers beforehand.
 This means that all headers (including the HTTP status line) must be at the beginning
 of the file. See the file moved/asis in the site directory as an example. Note that the
 header lines should be terminated with a CRLF not just an LF. There should be a blank line
 between the headers and the rest of the file. 
 <p>

 <h6>cgi-script</h6>

  When a cgi-script of this type is executed, all output from the script
 is redirected to a temporary file; when the script exits, WebJames reads
 the file and returns it to the host requesting the file.

 <p>
  When the request is a <code>POST</code>-request, the cgi-script can read
 the request-body from the standard input.

 <p>
  Scripts may not multitask, or use the BASIC/C cgi-lib included with
 WebJames, but languages such as Perl or PHP have their own libraries
 that provide this (and more) functionality. Information about the request
 can be found in the following system variables:

 <table>

 <h6>webjames-script</h6>

  The script is run with the following arguments:

 <dl>
 <dt><code>-socket N</code>
 <dd>socket to output data on
 <dt><code>-port N</code>
 <dd>portnumber used by the server

 <dt><code>-http version</code>
 <dd>http version * 10 (eg. 11 for HTTP/1.1)

 <dt><code>-head</code>
 <dd>if the request was a <code>HEAD</code> request
 <dt><code>-post</code>
 <dd>if the request was a <code>POST</code> request
 <dt><code>-put</code>
 <dd>if the request was a <code>PUT</code> request
 <dt><code>-delete</code>
 <dd>if the request was a <code>DELETE</code> request

 <dt><code>-rma address</code>
 <dd>address in RMA of a block of memory holding the entire request
     (header and all); the content of the block is not necessarily 100% 
     identical to the request; lines may have been added, removed,
     joined or altered; also lines are terminated by a single
     <code>LF</code>
 <dt><code>-file filename</code>
 <dd>instead of storing the header in shared memory, WebJames may choose
     to save it to disc
 <dt><code>-dynamic no</code>
 <dd>instead of storing the header in a file or in the RMA, WebJames may
     choose to store it in a dynamic area, and simply inform the
     CGI-script of the number of the dynamic area

 <dt><code>-size bytes</code>
 <dd>size of the -rma block or -dynamic area
 <dt><code>-remove</code>
 <dd>if included, the CGI-script should delete the -file file or release
     the -rma block or remove the -dynamic area

 <dt><code>-bps N</code>
 <dd>maximum bandwidth (in bytes/second) to use; if 0, there's no limit
     [<i>optional</i>]
 <dt><code>-host a.b.c.d</code>
 <dd>the IP-address of the client [<i>optional</i>]
 <dt><code>-host hostname</code>
 <dd>the hostname of the client [<i>optional</i>]

 <dt><code>-user username</code>
 <dd>if the cgi-script is password-protected, this indicates the username
     used to get access to the cgi-script
 </dl>

 Please notice:
 <ul>
 <li>if neither <code>-head</code>, <code>-post</code>, <code>-put</code>
     nor <code>-delete</code> is included, it is a <code>GET</code> request
 <li>only one of <code>-rma</code>, <code>-file</code> and
     <code>-dynamic</code> can be present
 </ul>

 <p>
  CGI-scripts should only store the actual CGI-script-code (or an obey-file
 that calls the actual CGI-script-code) in the cgi-bin directory. All other
 files (database files, graphics etc.) should be stored outside the site-
 directory.
  This is because any file in the cgi-bin directory may be run by a
 suitable request.

 <p>
  <code>&lt;WebJames$Dir&gt;.cgi-lib</code> is a BASIC library which
 hopefully makes it much, much easier for BASIC programmers to write
 CGI-scripts. It provides routines to send files, handle very long
 strings, parsing arguments, multitasking etc.

 <p>
  There is a relatively large overhead involved in starting a cgi-script,
 especially cgi-scripts that load large databases or open many files. It
 may be beneficially to write such scripts so that they are multitasking
 application that lie dormant until a smaller script invokes them, eg. by
 broadcasting a Wimp-message.

 <h6>server-parsed</h6>
  This handler provides support for Server Side Includes (SSI). These are
 normal HTML pages, but with commands embedded as comments. For example, the
 following code will output the size of the file
 <pre>
 ... the size of the file is &lt;!--#fsize file="foo.bar" --&gt;.
 </pre>
 <p>
  There should no spaces between the <code>&lt;!--#</code> and the command, but
  there should be at least one space between the last attribute and the
  <code>--&gt;</code>
 <p>
  If there are any spaces in the value of an attibute (foo.bar in the above
 example) then the value should be enclosed in quotes; if there are no spaces
 then the quotes are optional.
 <p>
  By default, all files with an extension of .shtml are treated as SSI files;
 this can be altered by editing the attributes file.
 <p>

 <p>
  If any of the values to attributes contain a $, then the following word is
 treated as a variable name, and is replaced by the value of the variable.
 The name of the variable can also be enclosed in braces to reduce ambiguity.
 This variable subsitution is most useful in <code>if</code> commands, but
 can be used in any of the other commands, for example:
 <pre>&lt;!--#fsize virtual="${DOCUMENT_URI}" --&gt;</pre>
 <p>
 The variables that are availiable are all system variables, all the variables
 that are set for CGI scripts, and the following:

 <table>

 <tr>
 <td valign="top"><code>DATE_GMT</code></td>
 <td>The current date/time in Greewich Mean Time</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td valign="top"><code>DATE_LOCAL</code></td>
 <td>The current date/time in the local time zone</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td valign="top"><code>LAST_MODIFIED</code></td>
 <td>The date/time that the current document was last modified</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td valign="top"><code>DOCUMENT_NAME</code></td>
 <td>The leafname of the current document (in unix format, eg. index.html)</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td valign="top"><code>DOCUMENT_URI</code></td>
 <td>The URL that caused this page to be requested</td>
 </tr>

 </table>

 <p>
  Conditional blocks allow you to include or not include a portion of the page,
 depending on a condition. For example:
 <pre>
 &lt;!--#if expr="$DOCUMENT_NAME=index.shtml" --&gt;
 we are in the index document
 &lt;!--#elif expr="$DOCUMENT_NAME=fred.shtml" --&gt;
 we are in fred.shtml
 &lt;!--#else --&gt;
 we are in an unknown document
 &lt;!--#endif --&gt;
 </pre>
 The elif condition is only evaluated if the if condition was false. The else
 section is only included in the output if none of the if/elif conditions
 matched. All comparisons are case sensitive.
 <p>
  The expressions can contain <code>=</code> equals, <code>!=</code> not
  equals, <code>&lt;</code> less than, <code>&lt;=</code> less than or equal,
  <code>&gt;</code> greater than, <code>&gt;=</code> greater than or equal.
  Several equalities can be combined, using <code>&amp;&amp;</code> logical
  AND, <code>||</code> logical OR, <code>!</code> logical NOT. Parentheses
  can be used to indicate precedence.<br>
  For example: <code>expr="$a=$b || !($d&lt;=$e && $f!=$g)"</code>
  <p>
  If the string on the right side of an equality operator starts and ends with
  a <code>/</code> then it is treated as a regular expression. 


 <p>
  <h6><a name="action">Action</a></h6>

  This attribute defines an alternative star command to use to start a
 redirect cgi-script. For example
 <pre>
 Action perl-script perl -w %f
 </pre>
  This will create a new handler called perl-script that will act the same
 as a redirect cgi-script, but use the star command <code>perl -w %f</code>
 where %f is replaced by the filename of the script requested.
 <p>
  This allows, for example, the normal runtype for a perl script when you
 double click on it to run the script in a taskwindow, but when run from
 WebJames as a cgi script it is single tasking.
 <p>
  There can also be a %u at the end of the command
 <pre>
 Action perl-script perl -w %f %u
 </pre>
  This will use Unix style redirection (eg. <code>perl -w filename &lt; input &gt; output</code>)
 rather than RISC OS style redirection (eg. <code>perl -w filename { &lt; input &gt; output }</code>).
 Unix style is recommended, as it causes less problems, but it cannot be used for BASIC or Obey
 scripts.
 <p>
  If you define an action with the same name as one of the built in handlers, then the action will
 override the built in handler. Actions can be defined outside of all sections in the attributes file,
 or inside a section, but the effect is the same.
 <p>
  You must define an action before you can use it in an AddHandler statement.

<p>
<h3>
<table bgcolor="#cccccc" width="99%"><tr><td>
<a name="putdelete">PUT and DELETE</a>
</td></tr></table>
</h3>

  When WebJames receives a <code>PUT</code> or <code>DELETE</code> request,
 it treats it as if it was a request for the file or cgi-script defined by
 the <code>put-script</code> or <code>delete-script</code> field in the
 <a href="#config">config file</a>.

 <p>
  If the request is for a 'redirected' cgi-script, the script will be
 started as usual, and can read the body of the request (if it was a
 <code>PUT</code> request) from the standard input, and should output the
 respons to the standard output - the name of the URI that is being
 attempted to <code>PUT</code> or <code>DELETE</code> is stored in the
 variable <code>ENTITY_PATH</code>.

 <p>
  <i>Please notice:</i> the default value of the
 <code>methods</code>-attribute disallows <code>PUT</code> and
 <code>DELETE</code> requests - you will have to manually enable these
 methods in the <a href="#attr">attributes-file</a>.

 <p>
  <strong>Supporting <code>PUT</code> and <code>DELETE</code> can be a 
 security risk -  you should not enable it unless you have to, and you
 should ALWAYS password-protect the scripts and only enable the
 <code>PUT</code> and <code>DELETE</code> methods for those scripts.
 </strong>

<p>
<h3>
<table bgcolor="#cccccc" width="99%"><tr><td>
<a name="contentneg">Content negotiation</a>
</td></tr></table>
</h3>

  It is possible to have a resource (HTML page, image, etc.) in several
 different formats. A browser can supply information on what formats or
 languages are preferable, and WebJames will return the file that best
 matches the browsers preference.
<p>
  The filename requested by the browser should <b>not</b> have an extension
 (ie. <code>page</code>, not <code>page.html</code>). WebJames will then look
 for a type-map file, which has a filename of, for example, <code>page.var</code>.
 The extension that is added can be altered by changing the line <br>
 <code>AddHandler type-map .var</code><br>
 in the attributes file.
 <p>
  The type map is in the same format as <i>Apache</i> uses, and consists of a
 section for each variant of a resource. Each section starts with a line
 <code>URI: page.en.html</code> where page.en.html is the URI of the resource
 relative to the type-map file.
 This is followed by one or more of the following lines
 <ul>
 <li>Content-type: the mime type of the file. Can also include a source quality
 factor and the charset that the resource uses. A quality factor is a number
 between 0 and 1 that indicates the relative 'quality' of the variant. A variant
 with a source quality of 0 will never be returned. If a source quality is not
 specified then it defaults to 1. Examples:<br>
 <code>Content-type: image/jpeg</code><br>
 <code>Content-type: image/png; qs=0.6</code><br>
 <code>Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-2; qs=0.4</code>
 <li>Content-Language: the language the file is written in. Examples:<br>
 <code>Content-language: de</code><br>
 <code>Content-language: en-us</code>
 <li>Content-Encoding: the encoding applied to the file. Encodings are not yet fully
 supported by WebJames. Example:<br>
 <code>Content-encoding: gzip</code>
 <li>Description: a human readable description of the variant. If WebJames cannot find
 a variant that satifies the browser's preferences then it will return a list of all
 possible variants, and will include this description in the list. Example:<br>
 <code>Description: The complete works of Shakespere in Swahilli</code>

</ul>

 There is an example of content negotiation supplied in the <code>Site/content</code>
 directory.
 <a name="multiviews"><h5>MultiViews</h5></a>

  It is possible to use content negotiation without having to create a type map file
 for each page. If you give a page or directory the multiviews attribute, then whenever
 a page is requested that does not have a filename extension, WebJames will scan the
 directory for other files with the same name but with an extension. It will
 effectively create a type-map on-the-fly based on the directory contents, and the proceed
 as with standard content negotiation. Files should be named <code>name.ext</code> or
 <code>name.lang.ext</code>. The ext will be converted to a mime type, and the lang,
 if present, will be used as the language.

<p>
<h3>
<table bgcolor="#cccccc" width="99%"><tr><td>
<a name="log">Logging/statistics</a>
</td></tr></table>
</h3>

  Logging is enabled by specifying a log file in the <a href="#config">
 config file</a>.

 <p>
  CGI-scripts (and other applications) may write to the log by use of the
 command <code>log</code>.<br>
  When compiling WebJames, the following options control the log:

 <p>
 <dl>
 <dt><code>LOG</code>
 <dd>must be defined to allow logging
 </dl>


 <p>
  The <code>CLF</code> (<code>Common Logfile Format</code>) logfile
 contains info about all received requests. The <code>CLF</code> format
 is used by many web-servers, including <i>Apache</i>.

 <p>
  The name of the <code>CLF</code> logfile is set in the <a href="#config">
 config file</a>.

 <p>
  For efficiency, the log data is buffered, so may not be written to the
 logfile immediately. The delay before writing the buffer, and the size of
 the buffer, are defined in the config file. Buffering can also be disabled
 by setting the buffer size to zero.

 <p>
  Both log files may be rotated when they become too old or too big; this
 is controlled in the <a href="#config">config file</a>. Rotation is
 performed by executing a command which is also defined in the config file.
 Instead of simply renaming the logfile, you may use a command like
 <code>Squash</code> or <code>ZipCompress</code> to compress the file -
 log files usually compress to 25% or less of their original size.

 <p>
  Alternatively, if the syslog option in the <a href="#config">
 config file</a> is set to 1, then both the main log and the clf log
 will be sent to Doggysoft's SysLog module rather than the files specified.

<p>
<h3>
<table bgcolor="#cccccc" width="99%"><tr><td>
<a name="bandwidth">Bandwidth</a>
</td></tr></table>
</h3>

  If you're on a slow network (eg. modem) you may not want replies to
 incoming requests to use more than a fraction of the bandwidth.

 <p>
  For a 33k6 modem, the maximum bandwidth is approx. 240000 bytes/min.<br>
 To force WebJames to use max 1/3rd of this, set bandwidth to
 240000/3 = 80000 bytes/min in the <a href="#config">config file</a>.

 <p>
  If the maximum bandwidth is set to 0, WebJames will use as much bandwidth
 as possible.

 <p>
  WebJames calculates the bandwidth-usage as a mean of the number of bytes
 written to the network over the last 1-2 minutes.
 <p>
  You can also use this option to simulate a slow link, so when you are testing
  your site locally you can see how long it would take to download over a modem.

  When an http-request fails (eg. the requested object cannot be found),
 WebJames checks if the file <code>&lt;WebJames$Dir&gt;.Reports.XXX</code>
 exists. (<code>XXX</code> is replaced with the status-code for the
 failure, eg. 404 for <code>object not found</code>).

 <p>
  If the report-file doesn't exist, a standard report is returned to the
 client.
 <p>
  These reports can be overridden on a per-directory basis using the
 <code>errordocument</code> attribute if required.

 <p>
  If the report-file exist, it will be returned to the client, after the

    like:<br>
    <code>report &lt;code&gt; &lt;socketno&gt; &lt;lines&gt; &lt;rmaaddr&gt;</code>

<table bgcolor="#cccccc" width="99%"><tr><td>
<a name="history">History</a>
</td></tr></table>
</h3>

<i>0.31 (??/9/2001)</i>

<ul>
  <li>reverse dns and syslog options are now runtime rather than compile time.
  <li>clf log will also be sent to SysLog when the syslog option is enabled.
  <li>split makefile into several different files, to enable different builds to be made more easilly
  <li>a few minor changes in the code to allow compilation with gcc, and linking with UnixLib.
  <li>added support for PHP as a built in handler.
  <li>fixed bug that caused image files to have their Content-Type: set wrongly.
  <li>new config option <code>imagedirs</code> that allows some image files to be treated as files, and others as directories, based on filetype.
  <li>fixed bug that caused a crash if you forced a shutdown from the taskmanager while there were still active connections.

</ul>

<i>0.30 (4/8/2001)</i>

<ul>
  <li>no longer converts %7E type escape characters that are in the query string.
  <li>sets more environment variables for CGI scripts: <code>REQUEST_URI, DOCUMENT_ROOT,
  HTTP_ACCEPT, HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE, HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET, HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING</code>.
  <li>added support for content negotiation and multiviews.
  <li>added the server-parsed handler for SSI files.
  <li>suports <code>Location:</code> and <code>Status:</code> headers output by CGI scripts
  <li>ensures all headers from CGI scripts have the correct line endings
  <li>outputs a <code>Date:</code> header in all responses

</ul>

<i>0.29 (30/3/2001)</i>

<ul>
  <li>added support for %7E type escape characters in URLs.
  <li>no longer faults POST requests from Oregano.
  <li>fixed bug that stopped the homedir attribute from working.
  <li>now treats image files as files rather than directories.
  <li>ANTRESOLVE and SYSLOG switches work correctly again.
  <li>added <code>#ifdef</code>s around all MemCheck code.
  <li>logfile output is now buffered, so the file is not kept open.
  <li>when a bad request is received, the reason why it was bad is
      added to the logfile.
  <li>if there is an error in a rexex or an unknown filetype when
      parsing the attributes file, then this is reported in the logfile.
  <li>added <code>log-header</code> command to config file, to allow
      arbitrary headers to be logged.
  <li>leaving the filetype empty in an <code>AddFileTypeHandler</code>
      now only applies that handler to any file that is not explicitly
      matched by another handler. The filetype of <code>ALL</code> can
      be used to apply the handler to all filetypes.
</ul>

<i>0.28 (1/1/2001)</i>

<ul>
  fixed a couple of bugs:
  <li>when an AddFiletypeHandler is used with an unknown filetype, it is now ignored, rather than being
      applied to all filetypes.
  <li>if an unknown handler is specified for a file, it now sends a no content report rather than leaving
      the socket open and not sending anything.
</ul>

<i>0.27 (27/12/2000)</i>

<ul>
  <li>added support for <code>&lt;files&gt;</code> sections in <a href="#attr">attributes</a> file
  <li>added support for <code>&lt;locationmatch&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;directorymatch&gt;</code>
      and <code>&lt;filesmatch&gt;</code> sections in <a href="#attr">attributes</a> file
  <li>changed C++ style comments to C style and indentation spaces to tabs
  <li>removed CASESENSITIVE compiler switch
  <li>added casesensitive config option (which even works on case-insensitive filesystems)
  <li>new attributes <code>stripextensions</code> and <code>setcsd</code>
  <li>redirect cgi environment variables are now removed after the script has finished executing
  <li>introduced handlers, <code>AddHandler</code>, <code>AddFiletypeHandler</code> and
      <code>Action</code>
  <li>added send-as-is handler
</ul>

<i>0.26 (19/10/2000)</i>

<ul>
  <li>attribute <code>defaultfile</code> can now take a list of files to look for
  <li>added support for the <code>SCRIPT_NAME</code>
      enviroment-variable when using 'redirected' cgi-scripts.
      This allows the <code>$PHP_SELF</code> variable to work in PHP scripts.
  <li>bugfix in leap year calculation
  <li>bugfix in assigning attributes - if a [/dir/] section was defined then the attributes for [/] were ignored for all files in dir
  <li>moved the site directory outside of !WebJames (perhaps the config and attributes need to move to Choices:?)
  <li>attributes can now be attr (space) value as well as attr = value
  <li>added support for <code>&lt;location&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code> sections in <a href="#attr">attributes</a> file
      (<code>&lt;files&gt;</code> to follow shortly)
  <li>added support for htaccess files
  <li>a new <a href="#attr">attribute</a> has been defined <code>errordocument</code>
  <li>changed value passed to Wimp_Initialise so it <i>might</i> work on RISC OS 3.10
</ul>


<i>0.25 (31/08/2000)</i>

<ul>
  <li>I (Alex Waugh) have now taken over the maintenance of WebJames
  <li>a couple of new <a href="#attr">attributes</a> have been defined:
      <ul>
      <li><code>allowed-filetypes</code>
      <li><code>forbidden-filetypes</code>
      </ul>
      these allow cgi-scripts to be executed only if their filetype is/isn't on the list,
      useful for keeping both PHP scripts and normal HTML in the same directory
</ul>


<i>0.24 (26/06/2000)</i>

<ul>
  <li>the various cgi-script related enviroment-variables are now set
      as literal strings and are set <em>every</em> time a CGI-script is
      executed, rather than just the first time
</ul>


<i>0.23 (19/12/1999)</i>

<ul>
  <li>fixed bugs which prevented CLF output from cgi-scripts and reports
</ul>


<i>0.22 (12/07/1999)</i>

<ul>
  <li>new attribute: <code>defaultfile</code> sets the name of the file to
      return when a request for a directory is received - this lets you
      return something else than <code>index.html</code>
  <li>WebJames now quits if it fails to bind the socket that listens for
      incoming connections
</ul>


<i>0.21 (24/06/1999)</i>

<ul>
  <li>when the server returns a <code>301 (moved)</code> or
      <code>302 (temporarily moved)</code> respons, the new URL is now
      absolute if possible (ie. if the <code>serverip</code> field in
      the config file is set)
</ul>


<i>0.20 (08/06/1999)</i>

<ul>
  <li>serious bug in <code>cache.c</code> fixed - when compiled with the
      <code>LOG</code> switch, WebJames crashed when loading a new version
      of an already cached file...
</ul>


<i>0.19 (06/06/1999)</i>

<ul>
  <li>tidied <code>stat.c</code>
  <li>fixed bug in <code>attributes.c</code> - spaces in <code>realm</code>s
      were removed...
  <li>some new <a href="#attr">attributes</a> have been defined:
      <ul>
      <li><code>more-attributes</code>
      <li><code>hidden</code>
      <li><code>nothidden</code>
      <li><code>ram-faster</code> (defined, but not yet implemented)
      <li><code>priority</code> (defined, but not yet implemented)
      </ul>
</ul>


<i>0.18 (16/05/1999)</i>

<ul>
  <li>added support for the <code>SERVER_ADMIN</code>
                        and <code>SERVER_PORT</code>
      enviroment-variables when using 'redirected' cgi-scripts
  <li>fixed a bug: <code>-put</code> and/or <code>-delete</code> arguments
      were not passed to 'webjames'-style cgi-scripts
  <li>the portnumber is now passed to 'webjames'-style cgi-scripts as
      part of the CLI-arguments (using <code>-port XX</code>)  BASIC
      cgi-lib updated to handle/ignore this
  <li>WebJames can now accept connections on multiple ports - simply
      specify a comma-seperated list of ports in the config-file
  <li>three new <a href="#attr">attributes</a> supported - if the
      <code>port</code>-attribute if defined for an URI, only request
      on the specifed port are accepted (this is only useful when
      WebJames is configured to listen on multiple ports); the
      <code>allowed-hosts</code> and <code>forbidden-hosts</code>
      attributes control which hosts can access the data
  <li>if the requested URI is a directory, a <code>301 Moved</code>
      reply is returned, with a <code>/</code> appended to the URI
  <li>if compiled with the <code>CASESENSITIVE</code> switch, URI matching
      is done case-sensitive.
</ul>


<i>0.17 (02/05/1999)</i>

<ul>
  <li>finally found a nice way to implement support for the <code>PUT</code>
      and <code>DELETE</code> request-methods
  <li>new <a href="#attr">attribute</a> supported - the
      <code>methods</code>-attribute defines which request-methods are
      allowed for an URI - this can be used to allow only <code>PUT</code>
      request to access the script defined by the <code>put-script</code>
      field in the <a href="#config">config file</a>
  <li><code>report_servererr()</code> added
</ul>


<i>0.16 (29/04/1999)</i>

<ul>
  <li>support for cookies when using 'redirected' cgi-scripts
</ul>


<i>0.15 (25/04/1999)</i>

<ul>
  <li>fixed bugs in <code>read.c</code>:<br>
      - an error was generated if WebJames <i>succeeded</i> in allocating
        a buffer for the body of a request!!<br>
      - failed to check when the entire request-body had been read<br>
  <li>fixed a couple of bugs relating to cgi-requests, <code>POST</code>
      now seems to work - or at least the few examples I've tried worked...
  <li>added <code>cgi-input</code> and <code>cgi-output</code> fields to
      the <a href="#config">config file</a> - these control the location of
      the spool-files used for redirected input/output to/from cgi-scripts
  <li><code>report_badrequest()</code> now replaces the <code>WHY</code>
      keyword in the report-file
  <li>added support for the <code>CONTENT_LENGTH</code>,
                            <code>CONTENT_TYPE</code>
      enviroment-variables when using 'redirected' cgi-scripts.
  <li>fixed bug in the BASIC cgi-lib - <code>CGI_MaxBytesPerSecond%</code>
      was set to 100 if WebJames specified <code>-bps 0</code>, ie. no limit 
</ul>


<i>0.14 (04/04/1999)</i>

<ul>
  <li>fixed bug in <code>cgi.c</code> (sometimes caused
       <code>QUERY_STRING</code> to be set to an incorrect value)
  <li>added support for the <code>SERVER_SOFTWARE</code>,
                            <code>SERVER_PORT</code>,
                            <code>SERVER_PROTOCOL</code>,
                            <code>SERVER_NAME</code>,
                            <code>PATH_TRANSLATED</code>,
                            <code>REMOTE_HOST</code>
      enviroment-variables when using 'redirected' cgi-scripts.
  <li>server ip-address/domainname can now be specified in the
      <a href="#config">config file</a>
  <li>fixed bugs in <code>resolve.c</code> so WebJames can now be
      compiled using the <code>-DANTRESOLVER</code> switch
</ul>


<i>0.13 (20/03/1999)</i>

<ul>
  <li>security-bug fixed - pasword-protection failed if the URI included
      arguments, eg. <code>/cgi-bin/query?q=whatsat</code>
</ul>


<i>0.12 (13/03/1999)</i>

<ul>
  <li>somehow <code>CR</code> and <code>LF</code> had been switched in
      <code>write.c</code> - although the exact same bug was fixed in
      v0.10b...
  <li>the <code>CLF</code> log wasn't rotated as specified in the
      <a href="#config">config file</a> and wasn't closed after the
      specified timeout
  <li>serious bug in the attributes-scanning-code fixed -  attributes
      were sometimes applied incorrectly (eg. the attributes for the
      file <code>/abc</code> were applied to the file <code>/abcde</code>)
  <li>when using 'redirect' cgi-scripts, WebJames writes
      <code>HTTP/1.0 200 OK</code> before outputting the file to the
      socket
</ul>


<i>0.11 (07/03/1999)</i>

<ul>
  <li>cgi-scripts that expect all output to go to the socket are now
      supported
  <li>the 'moved', 'access' and 'homedirs' database files have been
      dropped in favour of a much more flexible (and faster!) system
      where you can assign attributes (like password-protection,
      redirection, cacheability and more) to any UR - numerous minor
      and major changes to allow this... <em>this is still not fully
      tested yet</em>
  <li>MAJOR bug fixed - password-protection failed if you just changed the
      case of (any letter in) the URI; URIs are now case-insensitive - not
      perfect considering that many browsers assume otherwise, but for now
      it'll have to do
  <li><code>report_busy(connection)</code>   changed to
      <code>report_busy(connection, text)</code>
  <li>logfiles may be rotated either when they're too big or too old; the
      old logs can automatically be compressed
  <li>the duration for which logs are kept open after a write is now
      configurable
  <li>the maximum allowed size of a request can now be configured
  <li>the <code>connection</code> structure now has fields for the
      <i>User-Agent:</i> and <i>Referer:</i> lines from the
      request-header; these are now included in the <code>CLF</code> log
  <li>resolver handling moved to <code>resolve.c</code>
  <li>cache-heap handling moved to <code>cacheheap.c</code>
  <li><code>cacherefreshdelay</code> no longer used
  <li>rewritten to use OSLib... <em>hasn't yet been tested/compiled with
      the <code>-DANTRESOLVER</code> or <code>-DSYSLOG</code> flags</em>
</ul>


<i>0.10b (03/03/1999)</i>

<br>
  Thanks to Chris Bitmead
    <a href="mailto:chris.bitmead@bigfoot.com">
    &lt;chris.bitmead@bigfoot.com&gt;
    </a>:

<ul>
  <li>serious bug in <code>write.c</code> fixed - <code>CR LF</code>
      had been switched, so many browsers failed to read the header...
</ul>


<i>0.10 (07/02/1999)</i>

<ul>
  <li><code>quitwhenidle</code> command added and
      <code>&lt;WebJames$Dir&gt;.Restart</code> added -
      to kill and restart WebJames, simply double click on the WebJames
      icon in a filer window
  <li>cgi-lib has grown so big that it is now necessary to use
      <code>END=&18000</code>
  <li><code>report_badrequest(connection)</code>   changed to
      <code>report_badrequest(connection, text)</code>
  <li>if a cgi-script is password-protected, the username is passed to the
      script (as <code>-user &lt;username&gt;</code>)
  <li>rather than specifying a single username:password pair in the access
      file, you may now specify a file with any number of username:password
      pairs; the cgi-script <code>pwd</code> and the database file
      <code>users</code> demonstrate this
  <li>loglevel can now be set from the <a href="#config">config file</a>
  <li>HTTP version number is now read as major.minor
  <li>lots of bugs in and around <code>report.c</code> fixed
  <li>tidied the code for handling unimplemented request methods
  <li>cgi-lib has been updated to support the new <code>clf</code> command;
      it now also has support for sending <i>long</i> commands to WebJames;
      some small bugs fixed
  <li>tested the new <code>clf</code> command - works fine; WebJames no
      longer generates a clf-log-entry when a request results in a
      cgi-script being executed
  <li>the <code>!Run</code> file now checks for the presence of the MimeMap
      module, although not quite as extensively as JF suggested...
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><code>-DSYSLOG</code> can now be used to build a version that uses
      <code>SysLog</code>
  <li>logging levels are now reversed - high numbers are lower priority
      type messages; <code>LOGLEVEL_NEVER</code> is now the lowest level
      you can use
  <li>internal mimemap database deleted, and MimeMap module used instead
  <li>time conversion fixed
</ul>

<h5>PHP</h5>

  WebJames works well with the <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~ajw498/internet/php/">RISC OS port of PHP</a><br>
  With the default configuration you can put PHP scripts anywhere where you would put normal HTML.

<p>

<h5>Apache</h5>

  Although some of the features in WebJames are compatible with, or inspired by, Apache,
 non of the code has been taken from Apache. 
<p>
<h5>Recompiling WebJames</h5>

  The pre-compiled version of WebJames is usually compiled with the
 <code>LOG</code> switch <i>on</i>.

 <p>
  The <code>LOG</code> switch enables logging.

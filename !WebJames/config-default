# the site
# --------

# webmaster - the emailaddress of the webmaster; this is used to replace
# %EMAIL% in reports; the SERVER_ADMIN enviromentvariable (used by
# 'redirect' cgi-scripts) is set to this value
webmaster=i.havent@changed.the.emailaddress.com

# serverip - the ip-address (eg. 192.168.1.100) or full domain name
# (eg. www.myserver.com) of the server; if not known, leave empty; if
# possible, use the full domain name
serverip=

# server - included in the Server: fields when replying
server=WebJames/0.27

# port - http port number
# Webjames can accept connections on up to 8 ports simultaneously - simply
# specify a commaseperated list of portnumbers, eg.:   port=80,8080
port=80

# homedir - directory holding the files
homedir=<WebJames$Dir>.^.Site

# attributes - name of attributes file
attributes=<WebJames$Dir>.attributes

# accessfilename - name of file to look for directory specific attributes
accessfilename=/htaccess

# casesensitive - are filenames matched case sensitive;
# 0 no
# 1 yes
# this includes the homedir attribute above and any in the attributes file
casesensitive=0

# connection control
# ------------------

# timeout - idle delay in seconds before sockets are closed
timeout=200

# bandwidth - max bandwidth in bytes/minute
# this indicates how much of the bandwidth the web-server is allowed to use;
# set to 0 to allow unlimited bandwidth-usage; should otherwise not be lower
# than 30000
bandwidth=0

# readaheadbuffer - size (in kb) of file buffer
readaheadbuffer=24

# max-request-size
# first number is the maximum allowed size of a request body/header (in
# kbytes) second value selects when the server starts using the disc
# instead of the RMA for storing requests (currently not used)
max-request-size=200 100

# cgi-input - name of temporary file to use for redirecting input for
# cgi-script; the file is created when a POST request is received for
# a 'redirected' cgi-script, the request-body is written to the file and
# the cgi-script is started with input redirected so that standard input
# comes from this file; set to empty to use a file in the scrap-directory
# or set to somewhere on a RAMdisc to get speed
cgi-input=

# cgi-output - output from 'redirected' cgi-script goes to this file; set
# to empty to use a file in the scrap-directory or set to somewhere on a
# RAMdisc to get speed notice: 'redirected' cgi-scripts are always
# single-tasking so the same filename may be used for all requests... the
# same applies to cgi-input, although cgi-output and cgi-input cannnot
# refer to the same file...
# cgi-output=RAM:$.cgi-out

# reports/replies
# ---------------

# panic - html data that is send if something goes wrong,
# eg. if a report-html-file is missing; max 500 chars
panic=<html><head><title>HTTP request failed</title></head> <body bgcolor="#ffffff"><h3>HTTP request failed</h3></body></html>

# x-header - extra header-lines that are included when returning a file;
# multiple x-header fields may be included, but only the first 16 are used;
x-header=X-Server-Info: Acorn RiscPC, 200MHz StrongARM


# the cache
# ---------

# cachesize - cache size in kb
# to cache the entire site, the cache size should be the total size of the
# site + 1 kb for each file; also, MAXCACHEFILES (in cache.h) should be set
# to the number of files in the site; to disable caching, set cachesize=0
cachesize=512

# maxcachefilesize - files larger than this value (in kb) will never be
# cached; very large values will temporarily halt the server whilst the file
# is read in from disc...
maxcachefilesize=100


# logging/statistics
# ------------------

# log - log file
# remove the line to disable logging
log=<webjames$dir>.log

# loglevel - controls how much log data is output
# values from 0 (least logging) or 10 (most logging) are allowed; default
# is 5
loglevel=7

# clf - common logfile format - as used by Apache
clf=<webjames$dir>.clf

# reversedns - do reverse dns on connections
# -1    don't do reverse dns
# 0     only do reverse dns until all data has been sent
# > 0   attempt reverse dns for this many seconds after all data has been
# sent currently, reverse dns requires the ANT/Acorn resolver module
reversedns=10

# keep-log-open - keep the log/clflog open for this many seconds after a
# write; this removes the overhead involved in opening/closing the log files
# repeatedly
keep-log-open=90

# log-rotate - prevents the logfiles from getting too big
# first number is the maximum age (in hours)
# second number is the maximum logfile size (in kbytes) (0 for no limit)
# third number is the number of logfiles to keep (set to 0 to disable
#   rotation or to 1 to reset the logfile whenever it gets too big/old)
#
# to rotate the logs once a week, and keep the logs for 6 months, use:
# log-rotate=168 0 26
# clf-rotate=168 0 26
log-rotate=168 500 4
clf-rotate=168 500 4

# rotate-rename - command to execute when the log files are rotated
# %0 is replaced with the name of the log file
# %1 is replaced with the suggested name for the renamed file
# %2 is replaced with the leaf of the log file name
# you may use this to compress the old logs using your favorite archiver;
# notice that if you don't use %0 and %1 for the source/destination
# filenames, WebJames may not be able to rotate subsequent logfiles
rename-cmd=rename %0 %1


# PUT and DELETE
# --------------

# put-script, delete-script - when WebJames receives a PUT (or DELETE)
# request, it executes the 'put-script'; if 'put-script' points to a
# file that isn't a cgi-script, the file will be returned as usual
# PLEASE NOTICE: the scripts should be password protected to prevent
# just anybody from accessing them!

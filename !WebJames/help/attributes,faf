  The path to the 'attributes' database file is set in the 
 <a href="config#config">config file</a>; it is usually
 <code>&lt;WebJames$Dir&gt;.attributes</code>.

 <p>
  The 'attributes' database defines attributes for any number of
 URIs/files/directories. Attributes are things like <i>cacheability</i>,
 <i>redirection</i>, <i>password-protection</i>, <i>cgi-script API</i> and
 more. <i>Realms</i> are also defined in the 'attributes' file.

 <p>
  It is considered an attribute of a file that it may be executed as a
 cgi-script; therefore, the name of the directory (or directories) that
 hold cgi-scripts is defined in the 'attributes' file rather than in the
 <a href="config#config">config file</a>.

 <p>
  Attributes defined for a directory (eg. <code>/cgi-bin/</code>) apply to
 all files inside the directory; however, you may also define attributes
 for a single file or redefine attributes for files/URIs that have
 attributes defined elsewhere in the attributes file.

 <p>
  An attributes file consists of a number of sections, each section defines
 attributes for a file or directory.
 A section starts with eg. <code>&lt;location /uri/&gt;</code> and finished with
 <code>&lt;/location&gt;</code>.
 <p>
  <a href="vhosts">Virtual hosts</a> may also be defined in an attributes file.

 <p>
  If the URI ends in a <code>/</code>, it refers to a directory and all the
 files inside the directory; otherwise it refers to a file. The URI <b>must</b>
 start with a <code>/</code>.

 <p>
  The following fragment of an attributes file password-protects the
 <code>/private/</code> directory and all of its contents except the file
 <code>/private/busy.html</code>, and redirects the URI
 <code>/linux.html</code> to <code>http://www.linuxberg.com/</code> and
 also causes all request for URIs starting with <code>/~xyz/</code> to
 access a directory in the RAM disc and ensures that files in that
 directory will never be cached.<br>

 <pre>

 # password-protect (almost) everything in /private/
 &lt;location /private/&gt;
 userandpwd=myname:mypassword
 realm=privateparts
 &lt;/location&gt;
 # don't password-protect /private/busy.html, so just
 # set the password to &lt;empty&gt;
 &lt;location /private/busy.html&gt;
 userandpwd=
 &lt;/location&gt;

 # redirect /linux.html requests to www.linuxberg.com
 &lt;location /linux.html&gt;
 moved=http://www.linuxberg.com/
 &lt;/location&gt;

 # move /~xyz/ requests to the RAM disc, and don't
 # cache the contents of the RAM disc...
 &lt;location /~xyz/&gt;
 homedir=RAM:$.WebSite
 notcacheable
 &lt;/location&gt;

 # enable PUT-requests for the cgi-script that handles
 # PUT-requests
 #&lt;location /cgi-bin/PUT&gt;
 #methods="PUT"
 #&lt;/location&gt;

 # make private directory for 192.168.1.100
 &lt;location /private/johndoe/&gt;
 allowed-hosts=192.168.1.100
 &lt;/location&gt;
 </pre>

 <p>
  Please notice - you can only set a home-directory for
 <em>directories</em> - NOT for files (eg. for <code>/~xyz/</code> but
 not for <code>/~xyz/pic.gif</code>).

 <p>
  You can also create sections for specific directories using
 <code>&lt;directory ADFS::4.$.Dir&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/directory&gt;</code>
 The attributes within such a section will apply to anything fetched from
 that directory, whatever the URI was.
 <p>
  Attributes in a <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code> section take precedence over
 those in a <code>&lt;location&gt;</code> section.
 <p>
  It is preferable to use <a href="#htaccess">.htaccess</a> files rather than <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code>
  sections, as then if you move your website to a different directory on your hard disc, you
  don't have to alter all the <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code> sections.

 <p>
  There can also be <code>&lt;files&gt;</code> section, which apply the attributes
 to only files that have a leafname that matches. eg.
 <pre>
 # hide all files with a leafname of pic.gif
 &lt;files pic.gif&gt;
 hidden
 &lt;/files&gt;
 </pre>
 <p>
  <code>&lt;files&gt;</code> sections can be nested within a <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code> section, and then they
 will only apply to files within that directory.
 <p>
  Sections of the attributes file can be executed conditionally, depending if a
 particular handler is present, using an <code>&lt;ifhandler&gt;</code> section.
 If the hander name is preceded by a ! then the section is only executed if the
 handler is <i>not</i> present. <code>&lt;ifhandler&gt;</code> sections can be nested.<p>
 <pre>
 &lt;ifhandler cgi-script&gt;
 # This bit is ignored if the cgi-script handler is not compiled in
 &lt;location /cgi-bin/&gt;
 AddFiletypeHandler cgi-script
 &lt;/location&gt;
 &lt;/ifhandler&gt;

 &lt;ifhandler !php-script&gt;
 # This bit is ignored if the php-script handler is compiled in
 Action php-script php %f %u
 &lt;/ifhandler&gt;
 </pre>
 <p>
  Old style [/uri/] sections still work (they are treated as <code>&lt;location&gt;</code> sections), but their use is deprecated.

 <p>
 <h5>Regular expressions</h5>
 
 <p>
  In addition to the types of section described above, there are <code>&lt;locationmatch&gt;</code>,
 <code>&lt;directorymatch&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;filesmatch&gt;</code> sections. These take an
 extended regular expression, and apply it to the URI, directory or leafname respectively. If it
 matches then the attributes in the section are applied.
 <p>
  The regular expression matching is done by Henry Spencer's regex library.
 <p>
 Regular expressions are potentially complex, so I am not going to describe their syntax here.
 <pre>
 # this matches all leafnames that have between
 # 1 and 3 digits followed by .gif or .jpg
 &lt;filesmatch "^[0-9]{1,3}\.((gif)|(jpg))$"&gt;
 notcacheable
 &lt;/filesmatch&gt;
 </pre>
  The quotes around the regular expression are optional.
 
 <p>
 Matched subexpressions within the regex may be substituted into documentroot or overridename attributes inside locationmatch sections, using \1 for the first pattern, \2 for the second, upto a maximum of 9 patterns.
 <pre>
 # this matches html files in the stuff directory and changes the
 # extension to shtml
 &lt;locationmatch "^/stuff/(.*)\.html$"&gt;
 overridename /stuff/\1.shtml
 &lt;/locationmatch&gt;
 </pre>

 <p>
 <h5>The order of section matching</h5>
 <p>
  The order in which a request is processed is as follows:
 <ul>
  <li>The URI is compared with all <code>&lt;location&gt;</code> sections.
  <li>The URI is compared with all <code>&lt;locationmatch&gt;</code> sections.
  <li>The URI is converted to a filename.
  <li>The filename is compared with all <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code> sections.
  <li>The filename is compared with all <code>&lt;directorymatch&gt;</code> sections.
  <li>If the request was for a directory, the relevant <code>defaultfile</code> list is
      searched until a file is found.
  <li>The leafname is compared with all <code>&lt;files&gt;</code> sections, with ones
      nested within other applicable sections taking priority over those not nested.
  <li>The leafname is compared with all <code>&lt;filesmatch&gt;</code> sections, with ones
      nested within other applicable sections taking priority over those not nested.
  <li>The leafname and filetype will be compared to any <code>AddHandler</code> or
      <code>AddFiletypeHandler</code>.
  <li>The relevant handler will be called to deal with the file.
 </ul>
 <p>
  Therefore if you define an attribute for a whole directory, and the opposite
 attribute for a specific file within that directory, then the directory attribute
 will be applied first, but the file attribute will then be applied later, thus
 overriding the directory attribute.
 <p>

     </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td><code>Port</code></td>
 <td>This attribute tells WebJames which portnumber requests for the
     URI may be accepted on; if WebJames is configured to listen on
     multiple ports, this attribute can be used to hide the URI from
     incoming requests on all ports except one<br>
     example: <code>port=80</code></td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td><code>Allowed-Hosts</code></td>
 <td>This attribute lists the ip-addresses of all the hosts that are

     requesting browser; the first value is the priority level - from 0
     (lowest priority) to 100 (highst priority), the second value is
     optional - if present it sets the max no. of bytes per second to
     transmit when replying, 0 means no limit; default values are 100 and
     0; the <code>priority</code>-attribute may be (and currently is) ignored by WebJames<br>
     example: <code>priority=25,10000</code></td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td><code>Ram-Faster</code></td>
 <td>When this attribute is set for a cgi-script, WebJames is <i>allowed</i>
     to move the cgi-script to/from a faster filing-system (eg. RAM disc)
     whenever it is considered beneficial. (Not currently implemented)
     </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td><code>More-Attributes</code></td>
 <td>This attribute specifies the name of a file containing additional
     attributes; if the <code>more-attributes</code> appears inside an
     URI-section, the URIs in the file are considered relative to the
     URI for the section in parent-file<br>
     example: <code>more-attributes=&lt;WebJames$Dir&gt;.Site-Info.Attr1</code>
     </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td><code>DefaultFile</code></td>
 <td>This attribute lists the names of the files to look for if the remote
     host requests a directory, eg. <code>GET / HTTP/1.0</code>; the list is
     searched from left to right, and the first matching file found is returned;
     this attribute can only be set for directories, not files!!<br>
     example: <code>defaultfile=index.php,index.html</code>
     </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td><code>AutoIndex</code></td>
 <td>This attribute turns on directory listings. If a directory is requested, the defaultfile list is seached for a file to send. If no matching file is found, then an index will be autogenerated if this attribute is enabled.
     </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td><code>NoAutoIndex</code></td>
 <td>This attribute turns off auto indexing.
     </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td><code>Hidden</code></td>
 <td>When set, the file (or the contents of the directory) cannot be
     accessed.
     </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td><code>NotHidden</code></td>
 <td>When set, the file (or the contents of the directory) <em>can</em>
     be accessed; this attribute is mainly useful for enabling access to
     files that are stored in a directory which has the <code>hidden</code>
     attribute set.
     </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td><code>ErrorDocument</code></td>
 <td>This attribute allows error messages to be customised for individual directories.
     The first parameter is the http status code that the error message refers to. The second
     parameter is either a <code>&quot;</code> character followed by the text to send, or
     a URI to redirect to.
     You may have multiple <code>errordocument</code> lines for an URI, provided
     their status codes are different<br>
     example: <code>errordocument 404 &quot;&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;Sorry, this file was not found&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;HTML&gt;</code><br>
     example: <code>errordocument 403 /forbidden.html</code><br>
     example: <code>errordocument 500 http://www.somewhere.com/</code><br>

     </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td><code>StripExtensions</code></td>
 <td>This attribute strips the filename extensions from URIs before looking for the file.
     This includes the default files if a directory is requested, and any errordocument files as well.<br>
     Example: a request of <code>/wibble.html</code> would return the file <code>wibble</code>.
     </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td><code>MultiViews</code></td>
 <td>This attribute enables <a href="content#multiviews">MultiViews</a>. It can be considered as the
     opposite of <code>stripextensions</code>, and thus both should not be enabled within the
     same directory.
     </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td><code>SetCSD</code></td>
 <td>When set, the currently selected directory (CSD) will be set to the directory containing
     the CGI script before running the script.

 <td><code>AddHandler</code></td>
 <td>See the section on <a href="handlers#handlers">handlers</a> for more details.
     </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td><code>ServerName</code></td>
 <td>Sets the hostname of the server. Can only be at the top level or in a virtualhost
     section. If at the top level it can contain a hostname, and IP address or be blank.
     If in a virtualhost section it <i>must</i> specify a hostname. See
     <a href="vhosts">virtual hosts</a> for more details.
     </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td><code>ServerAdmin</code></td>
 <td>Specifies the email address of the server admin. Used when generating error reports
     and passed to CGI scripts in the SERVER_ADMIN variable. Can be at the top level or
     in a virtualhost section.
     </td>
 </tr>

 </table>

 The following attributes are included for backwards compatibility.
 <a href="handlers#handlers">Handlers</a> should be used instead.

 <table border="1" width="99%">
 <col span="1" width="150">

 <tr>
 <td><code>cgi-api</code></td>
 <td>this attribute tells WebJames how to start the cgi-script; allowed
     values are <code>redirect</code> and <code>webjames</code>; default
     is <code>webjames</code><br>
     example: <code>cgi-api=redirect</code></td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td><code>is-cgi</code></td>
 <td>allows the file (or all files in the directory) to be executed
     as a cgi-script(s)</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
 <td><code>isnt-cgi</code></td>
 <td>when included, the file (or the contents of the directory) may
     not be executed as a cgi-script - this is obviously the default</td>

 <td>this attribute lists the filetypes that may be treated as cgi-scripts;
     the value is a comma-seperated list of filetypes in hexadecimal
     - you may have multiple <code>allowed-filetypes</code>-lines
     for an URI; default is all filetypes; a blank list means all filetypes<br>
     note: this only affects files that have the <code>is-cgi</code> attribute set; files
     that have the <code>isnt-cgi</code> attribute will never be treated as cgi-scripts
     regardless of their filetype<br>
     example: <code>allowed-filetypes=18A,102,FFB</code></td>

 <tr>
 <td><code>forbidden-filetypes</code></td>
 <td>this attribute lists the filetypes that may not be treated as cgi-scripts;
     the value is a comma-seperated list of filetypes in hexadecimal
     - you may have multiple <code>forbidden-filetypes</code>-lines
     for an URI; default is no filetypes are forbidden; a blank list means no filetypes; if a filetype is listed
     in both the <code>allowed-filetypes</code> list and the <code>forbidden-filetypes</code>
     list then the forbidden list takes priority<br>
     example: <code>forbidden-filetypes=FAF,FFF,695,C85</code></td>
 </tr>

 <h5>Nested attribute-files</h5>

  The <code>more-attributes</code> attribute allows you to have nested
 attribute-files; eg. if multiple sites are served by the server, the
 attributes for each site may have its attributes defined in a seperate
 file.

 <p>
  Example: assuming the users <code>joe</code> and <code>bob</code> both
 have their web-site on your server; the main attributes-file could then
 look like this:

 <pre>
 # main attributes file
 &lt;location /~joe/&gt;
 more-attributes=&lt;WebJames$Dir&gt;.sites.joe.~attributes
 &lt;/location&gt;

 &lt;location /~bob/&gt;
 more-attributes=&lt;WebJames$Dir&gt;.sites.bob.~attributes
 &lt;/location&gt;
 </pre>

 The attributes-file (<code>&lt;WebJames$Dir&gt;.sites.joe.~attributes</code>)
 could then look something like this:

 <pre>
 # attributes file for joe
 # all URIs in &lt;location&gt; are relative to /~joe/

 # set the base-directory for joe's site
 &lt;location /&gt;
 homedir=&lt;WebJames$Dir&gt;.sites.joe
 &lt;/location&gt;

 # hide the attributes file for joe's site
 &lt;location /~attributes&gt;
 hidden
 &lt;/location&gt;
 </pre>

  All requests for URIs starting with <code>/~joe/</code> would then access
 files in the <code>&lt;WebJames$Dir&gt;.sites.joe</code> directory; notice
 that the attribute-file for joe's site itself is stored inside joe's
 site-directory; this would be a security risk, if the file hadn't been
 marked inaccessible (by the <code>hidden</code> attribute).

 <p>
 Notice - you should not nest attribute-files in more than 3 levels.

 <a name="htaccess"><h5>htaccess files</h5></a>

  You can also specify attributes for a directory by putting them in an
 <code>htaccess</code> file within the directory. The name of the <code>htaccess</code>
 file is specified in the <a href="config#config">config file</a>, and is by default
 <code>/htaccess</code>

 <p>
  The <code>htaccess</code> files are in the same format as the attributes file,
 but act as if the whole file was surrounded by a <code>&lt;directory dirname&gt;</code>
 section, where dirname is the directory the <code>htaccess</code> file is in.
 It can contain <code>&lt;files&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;filesmatch&gt;</code> sections,
 but not <code>&lt;location&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code> sections.
 <p>
  Please note that the <code>htaccess</code> files are cached, so if you alter one,
 then it may not take effect until you restart WebJames. Also, it you specify a
 <code>&lt;directory&gt;</code> section for a directory, then any <code>htaccess</code>
 file in that directory will be ignored.

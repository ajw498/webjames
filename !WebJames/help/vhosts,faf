  WebJames supports name-based virtual hosts. A virtual host allows you
 to have several different domain names all mapping to the same server,
 and the server can return different content based on which domain name
 it was accessed as.
 <p>
  To use virtual hosts, you must set up appropriate domain names to map
 to the ip address of the machine that WebJames is running on. You cannot
 just set up virtual hosts in the attributes file and expect them to work.
 The details of how to achieve this are outside the scope of this document,
 however if you only want to use virtual hosts for testing several sites and
 you are only ever going access them from the same machine as WebJames is
 running on then it is sufficient to add the domain names as aliases to
 localhost in your hosts file.
 <p>
  Once your domain as set up, you can define the behaviour of each virtual
 host in the <a href="attributes">attributes file</a>. A virtual host is defined
 between <code>&lt;virtualhost&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/virtualhost&gt;</code>
 sections. Within a virtual host section you may put anything that can
 normally appear in an attributes file, except for another virtualhost section.
 <p>
 The only thing that is mandatory within a virtualhost section is a servername
 attribute. This is nessacery to define what domain name maps to this virtual host.
 It is usual for each virtual host to have its own documentroot attribute as well.

 <p>
  An example of an attributes file defining several virtual hosts:<br>

 <pre>

 # Set the default attributes; these will be used for any request
 # that does not match a specific virtual host

 # The default servername attribute can be a hostname, an IP address,
 # or blank
 ServerName 192.168.0.1
 DocumentRoot IDEFS::Toffee.$.default

 # Set up a virtual host for the domain 'www.foo.com'
 &lt;VirtualHost&gt;
 # The servername attribute for a virtual host must be a hostname,
 # it cannot be a IP or blank
 ServerName www.foo.com
 DocumentRoot IDEFS::Toffee.$.foo

 &lt;Location /&gt;
 DefaultFile index.php
 &lt;/Location&gt;

 &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

 # Set up a virtual host for the domain 'bar'
 &lt;VirtualHost&gt;
 ServerName bar
 DocumentRoot IDEFS::Toffee.$.bar

 &lt;Location /baz/&gt;
 ErrorDocument 404 /error.html
 &lt;/Location&gt;

 &lt;Location /&gt;
 # The port attribute restricts this virtual host to only accept
 # connections on port 8080 (The port option in the config file must
 # also contain this port in its list)
 Port 8080
 &lt;/Location&gt;

 &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

  The name of the config file is passed to WebJames as the first argument
 when WebJames is started. Usually the config file is
 <code>&lt;WebJames$Dir&gt;.config</code>.

 <p>
  The config file holds information about the location (on your harddisc)
 of your website, the location of various database files, the maximum
 network-bandwidth WebJames may use, port number (usually 80), log-files
 etc. See the configuration file for details of the various options.

 <p>
  There are rather a lot of options in the config file, but usually you
 will only need to edit the first field - the webmaster-email-address.

 <p>
 <h5>Case sensitivity</h5>
  The case sensitive option allows you check that all your links between files
 are in the correct case. It works on standard filecore filling systems such as
 ADFS that are not normally case sensitive, but it is not quite as efficient
 as the default case insensivity.

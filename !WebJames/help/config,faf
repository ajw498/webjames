  The name of the config file is passed in the !Run file to WebJames as the first argument when WebJames is started. Usually the config file is
 <code>Choices:WebJames.config</code>.

 <p>
  The config file holds various bits of information that apply to the configuration of the whole server, such as the location of various database files, the maximum network-bandwidth WebJames may use, port number (usually 80), log-files etc. See the configuration file for details of the various options.

 <p>
  There are rather a lot of options in the config file, but usually the defaults will be sufficient for most purposes.

 <p>
 <h5>Case sensitivity</h5>
  The case sensitive option allows you check that all your links between files
 are in the correct case. It works on standard filecore filling systems such as
 ADFS that are not normally case sensitive, but it is not quite as efficient
 as the default case insensivity.

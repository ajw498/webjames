 <p>
 <h5>Installing this version from scratch</h5>

  To get things up and running, you will need to have an internet stack
 running. If you use the ANT suite, then you will need to ensure that
 local loopback is enabled.
 <p>
  If you have a driver for a network card already enabled then this should
 include loopback and so the loopback driver does not need to be explicitly
 selected.
  If it is not, then in the ANT configuration
 program, tick the LAN icon, then open the LAN setup window. Select
 <code>Loopback</code>
 from the driver list. Host name should be <code>localhost</code> and
 IP address <code>127.0.0.1</code> IP Mask <code>255.255.255.0</code> and
 leave Name server blank.
 <p>
 <p>
  The Acorn stack has loopback configured on by default.
 <p>
  You will also need the MimeMap module version 0.10 or later.
 <p>
  Copy WebJames to a suitable location on your harddisc or wherever you
 may want to install it. Start WebJames by double-clicking on its icon.
 No icon will apear on the iconbar, but you can check that it is running
 by seeing if it is listed in the Task manager.
 <p>
  Check that your web browser is not set up to use a proxy server. If it is,
 then you will have to turn it off, or add localhost to the list of domains
 to exclude. You will not be able to run !WebServe (or any other proxy server)
 on the same machine unless you set WebServe and WebJames to use different
 ports from each other. 
 <p>
  In your web browser, enter the URL <a href="http://localhost/">
 http://localhost/</a>, and you should get a page saying that WebJames
 is working.
 <p>
  You can now put your web pages in the <code>Site</code> directory
 or edit the <a href="attributes#attr">attributes file</a> to give the location of the pages.
 You should also change the webmaster email address and if possible server ip
 address in the <a href="attributes#attr">attributes file</a>.
 <p>
  The rest of the <a href="attributes#attr">attributes file</a>, and the <a href="config#config">config file</a> can be edited to suit your requirements, but the default
 values should be suitable to start with.  
 <p>
  The above assumes that you are running your browser on the same machine as
 WebJames is running on. If your broswer is running on another machine, either
 on a LAN or over the internet, then you should enter http://host/ in your
 browser where host is the hostname or IP address of the machine WebJames is
 running on.

 <p>
 <h5>Upgrading from an earlier version</h5>

 Move the old version somewhere out of the way, then copy the new version in its
 place. Versions 0.46 and earlier store the config and attributes files inside the !WebJames application. Newer version store them in Choices:WebJames. If upgrading from an old version you'll probably want to copy your config and attributes files from the old version to Choices:WebJames.

<table bgcolor="#cccccc" width="99%"><tr><td>
<a name="yoursite">About your site</a>
</td></tr></table>
</h3>

  The web site to be served by WebJames is usually stored in a single
 directory, and may hold any number of files and subdirectories. The path
 to the directory is set with the DocumentRoot attribute in the
 <a href="attributes">attributes file</a>.
 <p>
  However, much more complex arrangements are possible if desired
 by editing the attributes file.

 <p>
  The filepaths in incoming request will use unix-syntax instead of RISC OS
 syntax, so WebJames will switch / and . so the URI <code>/pics/file.gif</code>
 will refer to the file <code>pics.file/gif</code>.

 <p>
  If a request for a directory is received, WebJames will append
 the name of a default file (usually <code>index.html</code>) to the URI;
 thus a request for the URI <code>/whatever/</code> will usually return
 the file <code>whatever.index/html</code>. The name of the default file
 is an <a href="attributes#attr">attribute</a> of the directory, and so may be changed
 by editing the <i>attributes</i> file.

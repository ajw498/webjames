Here are some problems that have been encountered that are not WebJames bugs.
<p>
<h4>CSS</h4>
<p>
Some browsers will only take notice of CSS files if they have the correct mimetype, therefore you must make sure that the CSS files have their filetype set to CSS (f79) and that there is a mimemap entry to map this to the content type of <code>text/css</code>.
<pre>
  text/css		CSS		f79	.css
</pre>

 If you have problems with WebJames, the first thing to do is look in
 the log file. This may contain details if an error occured, or provide
 some clue as to what has happened. The logfile might be stored in !Syslog,
 or (if you have Select) from the Syslog configuration plug-in, or inside the
 !WebJames application directory.
 <p>
 If the problem is that WebJames is crashing or silently quitting, then it is
 usually best to use syslog rather than WebJames' internal logging, as if
 WebJames crashes it might not get a chance to write its internal log out to disc.
 <p>
 There is a mailing list for discussion of WebJames, PHP and anything related,
 see <a href="http://www.alexwaugh.com/">http://www.alexwaugh.com/</a> for details
 of how to join. If you want to know if something is possible, or how to achieve
 something, or to request a new feature, then the mailing list is the best place to
 ask, as other users may be able to help. I also read the mailing list.
 <p>
 Alternatively, you can <a href="mailto:alex@alexwaugh.com">email me</a>, especially
 if it is a bug report. In both cases, please state which version of WebJames you are
 using, and whether it includes the PHP handler or not. If you think it is appropriate,
 or if it is a bug report, please include the logfile.
 <p>
 Remember that the source code to WebJames is available, so if you are able to fix a
 bug or add a new feature then please send me a patch.

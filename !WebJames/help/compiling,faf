 WebJames can be compiled with Norcroft cc and linked with the shared C library,
 or compiled with gcc and linked with UnixLib, either natively or cross compiled
 with the <a href="http://www.hard-mofo.dsvr.net/gcc/index.html">gccsdk</a>.
 <p>
 To choose how to build WebJames, edit the Makefile, changing the BUILD= line as
 described in the makefile. If you are cross compiling you will also need to change
 DIRSEP to a slash rather than a dot.
 <p>
 If you are cross compiling then <code>make setup</code> will move all the .c and .h files
 out of their directories and add the appropriate extension.
 <p>
 There are several flags that can be defined to control which handlers get included:
 <ul>
 <li><code>SSI</code> include the server side includes handler
 <li><code>CGISCRIPT</code> include the CGI script handler
 <li><code>WEBJAMESSCRIPT</code> include the WebJames style CGI script handler
 <li><code>SENDASIS</code> include the send-as-is handler
 <li><code>CONTENT</code> enable content negotiation
 <li><code>LOG</code> enable logging
 </ul>

 The pre-compiled version of WebJames is usually compiled with all flags defined.
 <p>
 To prevent the possibility of security holes due to buffer overflows, string
 functions such as strcpy and sprintf that do not have length checking of the output buffer
 are not used in WebJames. To prevent any of these functions slipping in unnoticed,
 webjames.h #defines them to non-existant functions.

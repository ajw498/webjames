# WebJames attributes file
#
#  this file defines various attributes for URIs; an entry
# starts with an <location /URI/> or <directory dir>,
# the following lines define the attributes, then the section
# ends with a </location> or </directory> respectively.
#
#  if the URI is a directory (ie. it ends with a /), the
# attributes will affect all files and subdirectories in
# the directory; otherwise the attributes will only affect
# a single file
#
#  if you define attributes for both a file AND the
# directory in which the file is stored, the attributes
# defined for the file will overwrite the attributes for
# the directory
#
#  if you define attributes for both a <location> AND the
# corresponding <directory> in which the file is stored,
# then the attributes defined for the directory will overwrite
# the attributes for the location
#
#  possible attributes:
#
# userandpwd=login:password
# accessfile=filename
# realm=realmname
# homedir=path
# moved=newuri
# tempmoved=newuri
# notcacheable

# allowed-filetypes=list-of-filetypes

# errordocument statuscode "message
# errordocument statuscode urltoredirectto
#
#  if a file/directory is password-protected, a realm MUST
# be defined for that file/directory, otherwise it cannot
# be accessed
#
#  you can only specify homedir and defaultfile for
# directories, ie. if the URI ends in a /
#
#  URIs (like filenames) are case-insensitive in WebJames

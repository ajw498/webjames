# WebJames attributes file
#
#  this file defines various attributes for URIs; an entry
# starts with an URI enclosed in [], the following lines
# (until next entry starts or until the end of the file)
# define the attributes
#
#  if the URI is a directory (ie. it ends with a /), the
# attributes will affect all files and subdirectories in
# the directory; otherwise the attributes will only affect
# a single file
#
#  if you define attributes for both a file AND the
# directory in which the file is stored, the attributes
# defined for the file will overwrite the attributes for
# the directory
#
#  possible attributes:
#
# userandpwd=login:password
# accessfile=filename
# realm=realmname
# homedir=path
# moved=newuri
# tempmoved=newuri
# notcacheable
# cacheable
# cgi-api=webjames or redirect
# is-cgi
# isnt-cgi
# hidden
# nothidden
# methods=allowedmethods
# port=portnumber
# allowed-hosts=list-of-hosts
# forbidden-hosts=list-of-hosts
# priority=value
# ram-faster
# more-attributes=filename
# defaultfile=filename
#
#  if a file/directory is password-protected, a realm MUST
# be defined for that file/directory, otherwise it cannot
# be accessed
#
#  you can only specify homedir and defaultfile for
# directories, ie. if the URI ends in a /
#
#  URIs (like filenames) are case-insensitive in WebJames

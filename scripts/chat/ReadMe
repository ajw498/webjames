 WJChat - horribly ugly HTML-chat-cgi-script
 ===========================================

 About WJChat
 ------------
  WJChat is a horribly ugly cgi-script which implements a simple chat-
 server using HTML. It consists of two programs - a small cgi-script
 which converts a request to a wimp-message which is sent to the main
 program which generates the HTML.

  The supplied version is compiled to allow max 8 chat-channels and
 max 20 users, but you can recompile it to allow up to 255 channels and
 255 users.


 Installation
 ------------
  Copy the !WJChat directory to a suitable directory somewhere on your
 harddisc (doesn't matter where).
  Copy chat.cgi-bin.chat to the cgi-bin directory on your server.

  Start WebJames and a browser, start !WJChat and go to the url
          http://localhost/cgi-bin/chat

 Count - cgi-script for WebJames
 ===============================


 Installation
 ------------
  Copy the contents of the cgi-bin directory to the cgi-bin directory
 in your website-directory (usually !WebJames.site).
  Copy the count/html file to the website-directory.
  Copy the contents of the cgi-res directory to the cgi-res directory
 (!WebJames.cgi-res)

  The following HTML code will display a counter which is updated every
 time the page is reloaded:

  <img src="/cgi-bin/counter?id=0000&fg=000000&bg=ffffff">

  To use multiple independent counters, change the id to another value
 (in the range 0 - 4095).

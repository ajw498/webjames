 The miGIF compression routines do not, strictly speaking, generate files
 conforming to the GIF spec, since the image data is not LZW-compressed
 (this is the point: in order to avoid transgression of the Unisys patent
 on the LZW algorithm.)  However, miGIF generates data streams that any
 reasonably sane LZW decompresser will decompress to what we want.

 miGIF compression uses run length encoding. It compresses horizontal runs
 of pixels of the same color. This type of compression gives good results
 on images with many runs, for example images with lines, text and solid
 shapes on a solid-colored background. It gives little or no compression
 on images with few runs, for example digital or scanned photos.

| This is an example of how to make a cgi-script in the form of an obey-file
| 'echo' passes the argument through GSTrans, so to output characters like
| LF or < > " you need to use escape-sequences, ie. |j |< |> and |" for
| the characters LF < > and "
echo Content-Type: text/html|j
echo |<html|>
echo |<body bgcolor=|"#ffffff|"|>
echo |<h1|>Hello!!!!|</h1|>
echo |</body|>
echo |</html|>
